And `null` or `undefined` in an array or\n    object property whose value is `null` or `undefined` will be ignored. You\n    can change this behavior through `options.replace`.\n\n*   options.replace - `{function(this: Context, key: String|Number, value:Mixed): Mixed}`:\n\n    The function used to change the default text output.\n\n    *   `@this {Context}`:\n        *   `@property {Array.<String|Number>}` path: The key path to current value.\n        *   `@property {Table|Array}` table: The direct parent object.\n    *   `@param {String|Number}` key: The key of the value in current parent object.\n    *   `@param {Mixed}` value: The current value.\n    *   `@return {Mixed}` A string to change the value output, `false` to\n        cancel, `null` or `undefined` to remove the output.\n\n*   options.space - `{String|Number}`:\n\n    Specify the padding string for indentation.\n\n    If it is a non-negative integer N, then use N space \" \" for indentation. If\n    it is a string, then use this string for indentation. Otherwise, no\n    indentation will be performed.\n\n*   options.sort - `{function(a: String, b: String): Number}`:\n\n    The compare function for sorting table keys.\n\n    It is used for `Array.prototype.sort()`.\n\n#### tomlify.toValue(value, options)\n\nJust like `tomlify.toToml(table, options)`, it is used to transform a value into TOML\nvalue for a key-value pair. `value` cannot be null or undefined.\n\nHowever, an inline-table always fits into one line, no matter what it contains.\n\nE.g.\n\n```javascript\ntomlify.toValue({one: 1, two: 2});\n//=> {one = 1.0, two = 2.0}\n\ntomlify.toValue([\"apple\", \"banana\"], {space: 2});\n//=>\n//[\n//  \"apple\",\n//  \"banana\"\n//]\n\ntomlify.toValue([\n  {people: [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"]},\n  {fruits: [\"apple\", \"banana\"]}\n], {space: 2});\n//=>\n//[\n//  {people = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"]},\n//  {fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\"]}\n//]\n```\n\n#### tomlify.toKey(path, alternative)\n\n*   path - `{String|Array.<String|Number>}`: A key or a key path.\n*   alternative - `{Boolean}`: Whether numbers in the key path will be ignored.\n\nUse it to get a TOML key or key path for the key-value pair. E.g.\n\n```javascript\ntomlify.toKey('money');  //=> money\ntomlify.toKey('$');      //=> \"$\"\n\ntomlify.toKey(['sir', 'Mr. Smith']);        //=> sir.\"Mr. Smith\"\ntomlify.toKey(['food', 0, 'price']);        //=> food.[0].price\ntomlify.toKey(['food', 0, 'price'], true);  //=> food.price\n```\n\n\n### Known Problems\n\n*   JavaScript does not have any integer type.\n\n    All numbers are floats in JavaScript. Any integer bigger than\n    Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER (9007199254740991 < 2^63 - 1) or smaller than\n    Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER (-9007199254740991 > -(2^63 - 1)) is not safe when\n    being converted or used as a pure integer! You should store big integers in\n    strings.\n\n    All numbers are transformed into floats by default. You can change this\n    behavior by using a replacer function with tomlify-j0.4.\n","time":{"created":"2022-01-27T01:03:47.737Z","modified":"2023-08-02T10:14:30.746Z","3.0.0":"2017-11-01T23:30:39.201Z","3.0.0-alpha.0":"2017-10-04T23:33:20.168Z","2.2.1":"2017-09-14T04:15:40.741Z","2.2.0":"2017-07-22T21:53:34.352Z","2.1.1":"2017-07-22T06:59:18.615Z","2.1.0":"2017-07-22T06:23:01.693Z","2.0.0":"2017-04-17T04:54:07.122Z","1.0.4":"2017-04-16T04:52:20.575Z","1.0.3":"2017-04-15T07:06:20.323Z","1.0.2":"2017-04-14T16:23:48.271Z","1.0.1":"2015-04-21T15:51:33.517Z","1.0.0":"2015-04-20T14:29:10.492Z"},"versions":{"3.0.0":{"name":"tomlify-j0.4","version":"3.0.0","description":"A
